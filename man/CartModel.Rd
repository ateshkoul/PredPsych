\title{Generic Classification and Regression Tree Function}
\usage{
CartModel(Data, responseCol, selectedCol, tree, ...)
}
\description{
simple function to create Classification and Regression Trees
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Inputs
  \itemize{
    \item Data = a data frame with regressors and response
     \item responseCol = which column should be used as response col
     \item selectedCol (optional) = which columns should be treated as data(features + response) (defaults to all columns)
     \item tree = which cart model to implement; One of the following values:
     modelF = Full Model Tree; 
     modelNAHF = crossvalidated Half Model Tree removing missing values;
     modelHF = crossvalidated Half Model Tree With missing values;
     modelCF = Conditional inference framework Tree;
     modelRF = Random Forest Tree;
}
}

\itemize{
\item Outputs
  \itemize{
    \item Results = Cart model result for the input tree
}
}
